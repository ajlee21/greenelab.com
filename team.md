Our lab is made up of a highly engaged and collaborative team of researchers.
We recognize the value of diversity in the process of discovery, and we foster an environment where team members are treated equally and we respect and admire our differences.
The team includes postdocs, students at all levels, staff, and our lab mascots.

Our research depends upon more than just our immediate lab members.
We work with a wide range of outstanding groups from around the world, and we're always on the lookout for new and unique perspectives.
We want to push the frontier of data science and train the next generation of data scientists.

Gone but never forgotten.

They have all made lasting contributions to science and to our hearts. ❤️
