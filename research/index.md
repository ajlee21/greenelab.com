There are millions of samples that have been subjected to genome-wide profiling and these data are freely downloadable.
Our lab develops algorithms that integrate these data to help us understand how biological systems work.
The breadth of these data help us probe many different biological conditions, including those with limited data, such as rare diseases.
We recognize that our lab won't have all the answers, or even all of the questions, so we aim to develop systems that any biologist can use to interpret these data.
We also strive to make our workflows robust and reusable for other computational scientists.
Our open, rigorous and transparent approach to research facilitates such reuse.
