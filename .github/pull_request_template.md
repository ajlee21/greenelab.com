Request a review from @cgreene if you're changing Markdown files (.md), image files (.jpg, .png, etc.) (except for /favicons), or YAML files (.yml) in /_data. 

Request a review from @vincerubinetti (or equivalent expertise in the template) if you're changing anything else.

When in doubt, request a review from both.
