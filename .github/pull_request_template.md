If you are modifying .html files, .css files, .js files, liquid syntax, icons, config files, bash scripts, or python scripts, request a review from @vincerubinetti or someone else very knowledgeable in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Jekyll.

If you are modifying .md files or /images files, request a review from @cgreene.

When in doubt, request a review from both.
