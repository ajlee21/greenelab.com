The Greene Lab is a [data science lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_lab) at the [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/).

We are a team of researchers dedicated to answering important questions in biology and medicine.
Our work focuses on bringing together publicly available "[big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)", developing new computational methods to analyze that data, and creating tools to put those pieces into the hands of every biologist.
