    - title: Adage
      thumbnail: adage.jpg
      url: https://adage.greenelab.com/
      description: Adage helps you explore gene expression data and discover new insights from machine learning models. See how genes relate to each other, other genes, and how they are represented in machine learning signatures. View the activities of samples as a colored heatmap, and cluster them on the fly. Explore the genes that contribute to signatures, the experiments in which they vary the most, and the pathways they significantly overlap with.

    - title: AnnoRxiver Journal Recommender
      thumbnail: annorxiver.png
      url: https://greenelab.github.io/annorxiver-journal-recommender/
      description: AnnoRxiver Journal Recommender uses a machine learning model trained on 1.7 million PubMed Central open access documents to recommend suitable journals based on the textual content of your bioRxiv preprint. It also provides a "map" of the PubMed Central documents, grouped into bins based on similar textual content, and shows you where your preprint falls on the map.

      url: https://het.io/search/
      description: Connectivity search allows you to find the most important paths connecting any two nodes in Hetionet, even when they are different types or not known to be related. If you want to investigate how the [eye and breast](https://het.io/search/?source=28127&target=6602&metapaths=AeGaD) cancer may be related, you can. Filter nodes by type, see computed significance data about paths, create graph visualizations with highlighted paths, and more.
